Overview:  
This application allows users to log in using their Google account through OAuth 2.0.  
After logging in, users will see their profile information displayed on a profile page.  
A logout option is provided to end the session and return to the home page.

- Example: `http://localhost:3000/auth/google`

**2.3 Callback Route (`/auth/google/callback`)**  
- Description: Handles Google's response and redirects to the profile page on success.  
- Example: Automatically triggered by Google after login.

**2.4 Profile Route (`/profile`)**  
- Description: Displays the logged-in user's Google profile information.  
- Example: `http://localhost:3000/profile`

3. **Testing the Application:**

Step 1: Start the Application:  
```bash
node index.js
```

Step 2: Visit the Home Page:  
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/`  
- You should see the "Login with Google" link.

Step 3: Log in with Google:  
- Click the "Login with Google" link.  
- You will be redirected to Google's login page.

Step 4: Authorize the App:  
- Log in with your Google credentials.  
- On success, you will be redirected to the profile page.

Step 5: View Profile Information:  
- Confirm that your name, email, and profile picture are displayed.

Step 6: Logout:  
- Click the "Logout" link on the profile page.  
- You should be redirected to the home page.

Step 7: Access Control Check:  
- Try visiting `http://localhost:3000/profile` directly after logging out.  
- You should be redirected to the home page since you are no longer authenticated.

4. **Troubleshooting:**  
- If you encounter "Invalid Redirect URI", ensure the redirect URI matches what is configured in Google Developer Console.  
- If the login fails, check that your Client ID and Client Secret are correct.  
- If the profile page doesnâ€™t display, ensure the user object is correctly serialized and deserialized.

5. **Conclusion:**  
This implementation demonstrates how to integrate Google OAuth 2.0 in an Express.js application.  
The application provides secure login, profile rendering, and session management using Passport.js and Express sessions.
